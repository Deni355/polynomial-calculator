# Polynomial Calculator

## Description
This is a polynomial calculator written in Python that allows users to:
- Find all real roots of a polynomial.
- Verify if a given value is a root of a polynomial.

This project includes two versions:
- NumPy Version: Uses numpy for efficient root calculations.
- Pure Python Version: Implements polynomial root finding without external libraries, showcasing basic Python logic.

## Features
- Find all real roots of a polynomial.
- Verify if a specific value is a root.

Two implementations: NumPy-based and pure Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library (for the NumPy version)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deni355/polynomial-calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd polynomial-calculator

3. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## To run the program

- Pure Python Version:
   ```bash
   python polynomial_calculator.py

- NumPy Version:
   ```bash
   python polynomial_calculator_numpy.py
